function [win] = checkDownRightMedialTwo(row, column, board, type)
    %This function executes when the program wants to check to the down and
    %right of the most recently placed piece to see if there are four in a
    %row and the player has won

    %been proven that the player has won yet

    %since it is known that there is at least one piece in the row starting
    %at the origin

    %This series of nested if statements checks each position on the board
    %to the down and to the right of the starting position incrementally
    %until either one of those positions doesn't contain the right type of
    %chip or count equals four

    %output variable is set to true
